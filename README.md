# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
This application allows you to search both current weather conditions
and five-day forecasts by city. Upon searching, the application provides
the user with the following information:
- Temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)
- Humidity 
- Wind Speed (in MPH)
- UV Index (for current conditions only).

The application stores the search history such that users can click on recent history
to update the search. Users may also clear their history with a delete button.

If a user enters a search already in their search history, that location will move to the 
top of the search history and will not repeat.

## Built With
* HTML (with bootstrap)
* CSS (With external stylesheets, including FontAwesome).
* Javascript (With external scripts such as moment.js)
* JQuery 
* Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/api)
